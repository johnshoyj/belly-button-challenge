# belly-button-challenge

In this challenge I complete the following tasks:

1. Used the D3 library to read in the json
2. Created a horizontal bar chart to show the top 10 OTUs found in an individual (when applicable)
3. Created a bubble chart that counts the bacteria per each sample
4. Displays the sample metadata within a demographic summary container

When a new ID is selected from the dropdown this causes all of the plots to update with that particular sample's data.

The link to the dashboard containing these data is: https://johnshoyj.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

The work submitted in this challenge is a result of my learning and resources gained during the UMN Data Analytics Bootcamp.
